We are developing a patient information management system, named "ASHA fusion", which can be easily used by medical staffs in rural areas of Nepal.

We have conducted trials in a hospital and a health camp with supports of local partners in order to introduce our software into practice.

Moreover, we expect our software to become even more helpful to improve public health by collecting a lot of information and extracting insights from it.
