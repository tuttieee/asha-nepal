### Trial

In March 2016, our team went to Nepal and conducted a health camp using the first version of our software "ASHA fusion" with supports of local NGO and doctors. Local doctors and nurses used ASHA fusion and give us lots of feedbacks with good feelings.
Furthermore, we tried to introduce ASHA fusion to the hospital operation.

### Future

Our team started to develop more convenient system based on the feedbacks from the users.
We will continue to improve our system and to spread to health camps and hospitals by going there continuously.
