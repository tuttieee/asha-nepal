**ASHA Nepal Project** aims to improve public health and mental care in rural areas of Nepal with IT.

Some of our team members went to Nepal and conducted a health camp just after the April-May 2015 Nepal earthquake and found a lack of patient information management and sustainable health support. After that, we launched this project to address these problems.

Our team consists of medical staffs such as doctors and nurses as well as engineers. We are developing an useful software application to manage and share patient information efficiently and to provide sustainable health support.
