**ASHA Nepal Project** aims to improve the public health and mental care in rural areas of Nepal with IT.

Some members went Nepal and conducted a health camp just after the Nepal earthquake and found the the lack of patient information management and sustainable health support. After that, they started this project to solve these problems.

Our team consists of medical staffs such as doctors and nurses as well as engineers. We are developing an useful software to manage and share patient information efficiently and to supply sustainable health support.
