      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ASHA Nepal Project&lt;/strong&gt; aims to improve the public health and mental care in rural areas of Nepal with IT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some members went Nepal and conducted a health camp just after the Nepal earthquake and found the the lack of patient information management and sustainable health support. After that, they started this project to solve these problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our team consists of not only medical staffs such as doctors and nurses but also engineers. We are developing an useful software to manage and share patient information efficiently and to supply sustainable health support.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We are developing a patient information management system, named &amp;ldquo;ASHA fusion&amp;rdquo;, which can be easily used by medical staffs in rural areas of Nepal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have conducted trials in hospital and health camp with supports of local parters in order to introduce our software into the real situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, we expect our software will get helpful to improve public health by collecting a lot of information and extracting insights from it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;trial:10be9c81b9315bdc8704629d17642664&#34;&gt;Trial&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In March 2016, our team went to Nepal and conducted a health camp using the first version of our software &amp;ldquo;ASHA fusion&amp;rdquo; with supports of local NGO and doctors. Local doctors and nurses used ASHA fusion and give us lots of feedbacks with good feelings.
Furthermore, we tried to introduce ASHA fusion to the hospital operation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;future:10be9c81b9315bdc8704629d17642664&#34;&gt;Future&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our team started to develop more convenient system based on the feedbacks from the users.
We will continue to improve our system and to spread to health camps and hospitals by going there continuously.&lt;/p&gt;
